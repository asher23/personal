                <p class="about-paragraph">Abrar here. I’m an aspiring software developer looking to start a career in software
                    development. During my freshman year at college, a friend and I started my own maid service. It took us
                    about a month to go from idea to launch, and we ran it for around 6-7 months. I’d always wanted to study
                    business and be an entrepreneur ever since my early days in high school, so that’s why I decided to start
                    the business. However, during my time running it, I came across the world of web and software development
                    and I slowly fell in love with it. I began studying on my own, taking courses online on Udemy.com, and other
                    classes in the city. I then attended Fullstack Academy a few months later, taking the next semester off to
                    attend.</p>
                <p class="about-paragraph">Now, I’m currently looking for internships or full-time/part-time work to really
                    develop my skill set and gain more experience in a professional environment. I’ve never really been a big
                    fan of a classroom environment, so the plan was to attend the bootcamp and start working full-time. I’ve
                    found that to be difficult to do without a college degree, so now I’m back in school building projects and
                    hoping to intern at places where I can really gain more experience. </p>
